<h2>Objectives</h2> 

<p>There are three objectives to this assignment:</p> 

<ul>
<li>Learn how to use mutexes and condition variables effectively.</li> 

<li>Learn how web crawlers utilize links to explore the online graph.</li> 

<li>Build a library that uses callbacks.</li> 
</ul> 

<h2>Background</h2> 

<p>Search engines (e.g., Google) perform several tasks internally.
First, they <b>download</b> pages from the Internet. Second, they <b>
parse</b> the downloaded content, looking for links to new, unknown
content. Third, they use link counts and other factors to determine
what a page is about and how important it is. Fourth, they handle
user queries, returning content that is relevant and important. The
first two tasks (downloading and parsing) are performed by a web
crawler.</p> 

<p>In this assignment, you will be developing a real, working <b>web
crawler.</b> To simplify this project, your crawler will parse web pages
in a simplified format (not HTML). In order to achieve high
performance, your crawler will use multiple threads, for two reasons.
First, the latency of fetching a web page can be on the order of 100s
of milliseconds. Thus, a single threaded crawler might only fetch 10
pages per second. By issuing many concurrent requests from multiple
threads, you will avoid this bottleneck. Second, most modern
computers have multiple CPU cores. By splitting parsing across
multiple threads, can fully utilize your computer's CPU.</p> 

<p>To help you get started, we have provide some skeleton code:</p> 

<p><pre>wget http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~harter/537/p4/p4a.tar.gz</pre> </p> 

OR

<p><pre>cp ~harter/public/html/537/p4/p4a.tar.gz .; tar -xf p4a.tar.gz</pre> </p> 

<h2>Thread Pools</h2> 

<p>Your crawler will have two groups (or pools) of threads. The <b>
downloaders</b> will be responsible for fetching new pages from the
Internet. The <b>parsers</b> will scan the downloaded pages for new
links.</p> 

<p>Note the circular interactions between the two groups. When a
downloader fetches a new page, it creates more work for a parser.
Similarly, when parser finds a new link, it creates more work for a
downloader.</p> 

<h2>Queues</h2> 

<p>The downloaders and the parsers will send work to each other via two
queues.</p> 

<p>First, you will implement a fixed-size queue for parsers to send
work to downloaders. Parsers will push new links onto the queue, and
downloaders will pop them off. A parser must wait if the queue is
full, and a downloader must wait if the queue is empty. Note that
this is the canonical producer/consumer problem, so you will need one
mutex and two condition variables.</p> 

<p>Second, you will implement an unbounded queue for downloaders to
send work to parsers. Unbounded simply means that you malloc memory
for each new entry, so you can always insert another entry into the
queue (unless, of course, you run out of memory and malloc fails; in
that case, it is ok to exit). Note that with an unbounded buffer no
thread will ever need to wait because the queue is full. Thus, while
this queue represents a producer/consumer problem, you may not need
the standard code with two condition variables and a mutex.</p> 

<h2>Callbacks</h2> 

<p>Your code will deployed as a library so that different applications
that need to do web crawling may use it. Your library will use
callbacks to provide the most flexibility.</p> 

<p>In particular, a program using your crawler library will pass two
function pointers to the library. You crawler will call the provided
fetch() function to retrieve web-page content. Using the callback
enables you to work with multiple protocols. Generally, fetch() will
issue HTTP requests to web servers, but alternate implementations may
fetch data over FTP or may even fetch data from the local file
system (our tests will do the latter).</p> 

<p>When your crawler finds a new link in a page, it will do two
things: (1) add the link to the downloaders' work queue, and (2)
return the link (or edge) to the program using your library. You will
return the edge by calling the provided edge() function.

<h2>Format</h2> 

HTML links generally look like this:

<p><pre>&lt;a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2016/"&gt
Fun, Free Projects!
&lt;/a&gt;</pre> </p> 

You're free to write a parser to find such URLs, but we'll be sharing
websites for you to crawl that follow a simpler format (all tests will
follow the simple format). In particular, a link to addr will be
prefixed by  link: and have a following space (or come at the end of
the document):

<p><pre>link:addr</pre> </p> 

<h2>Library Specifications</h2> 

<p>Your shared library must provide the following function:

<p><pre>
int crawl(
char *start_url,
int download_workers,
int parse_workers,
int queue_size,
char * (*fetch_fn)(char *link),
void (*edge_fn)(char *from, char *to)
);
</pre> </p> 

<p>crawl() will return 0 on success and -1 on failure.</p> 

<p>The arguments are as follows:
<ul>
<li>start_url: the first link to visit. All other links will be discovered
by following links out recursively from this first page.</li> 
<li>download_workers: the number of worker threads in the download pool.</li> 
<li>parse_workers: the number of workers threads in the parse pool.</li> 
<li>queue_size: the size of the links queue (the
downloaders pop off this queue to get more work).</li> 
<li>fetch_fn: a callback to ask the program using the library to fetch
the content to which the link refers. The function will return NULL
if the content isn't reachable (a broken link). Otherwise, the function
will malloc space for the return value, so you must free it when you're done.</li> 
<li>edge_fn: this is to notify the program that the library encountered a
link on the from page to the to page.</li> 

</ul> </p> 

<h2>Shared Library</h2> 

<p>You must provide these routines in a shared library named
"libcrawler.so". Placing the routines in a shared library instead of a simple
object file makes it easier for other programmers to link with your
code. There are further advantages to shared (dynamic) libraries over static
libraries. When you link with a static library, the code for the entire
library is merged with your object code to create your executable; if you link
to many static libraries, your executable will be enormous. However, when you
link to a shared library, the library's code is not merged with your program's
object code; instead, a small amount of stub code is inserted into your object
code and the stub code finds and invokes the library code when you execute the
program. Therefore, shared libraries have two advantages: they lead to smaller
executables and they enable users to use the most recent version of the
library at run-time. To create a shared library named libcrawler.so, use the
following commands (assuming your library code is in a single file "crawler.c"):</p> 

<p><pre>
gcc -c -fpic crawler.c -Wall -Werror
gcc -shared -o libcrawler.so crawler.o
</pre> </p> 

<p>To link with this library, you simply specify the base name of the library
with "-lcrawler" and the path so that the linker can find the library "-L.".</p> 
<p><pre>
gcc -lcrawler -L. -o myprogram mymain.c -Wall -Werror
</pre> </p> 

<p>Of course, these commands should be placed in a Makefile. Before you run
"myprogram", you will need to set the environment variable, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
so that the system can find your library at run-time. Assuming you always run
myprogram from this same directory, you can use the command:</p> 
<p><pre>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre> </p> 


<h2>Implementation Hints</h2> 

<p>Your library should use pthreads. You should take an especially close
look at pthread_create, pthread_cond_wait, pthread_cond_signal,
pthread_mutex_lock, and pthread_mutex_lock. An implementation that
spins instead of using condition variables will receive a poor grade
(even if it passes the tests).</p> 

<p>Your crawl() function should return when the entire graph has been
visited, but we don't require you to cleanly exit from the thread
pools.</p> 

<p>If you want to use strtok() for parsing, you should use strtok_r()
instead. The strtok_r() is reentrant, or thread safe (i.e., multiple
threads can call it at the same time and nothing breaks). The
strtok() function is not thread safe.</p> 

<p>There are many cycles in the web graph (e.g., A links to B, and B
links to A). You need to make sure not to end up in an infinite loop.
One way to avoid this is to use a hash table or hash set to keep track
of already-processed links. You may copy a hash function from online
(e.g., <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher%27s_checksum>
fletcher32</a> ), as long as a comment in your code references the source
URL.
